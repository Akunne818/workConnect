Chief of Staff,Coiled,Remote,"About Us Coiled is a commercial company that helps data professionals more effectively use the open-source Python data stack. Our core product, also called Coiled, helps users with cloud deployments of the parallel computing library Dask from small to massive scales so they can process their data quickly and affordably. Our team has historically been highly technical and geared toward engineering. Users love the Coiled product, and we recently hired a sales team to accelerate go-to-market. As a result, Coiled's operational needs are changing quickly. About the Opportunity Coiled is seeking a Chief of Staff who will report to the VP of Finance and Operations. This role requires a strong entrepreneurial mindset, comfort getting into the weeds, and excitement about cross-functional work that sets the organization up for success. You should be ready to wear many hats in People Operations, Finance, Marketing, and more. We're looking for a hungry, highly analytical, and detail-oriented generalist who is comfortable context-switching when the business requires it. You may have spent time in multiple functions, you enjoy project managing, and most of all you like getting shit done. The Job Here's what we have in mind: Collaborate with the leadership team: Any project or problem on Coiled's plate is automatically on your plate. This means you'll solve some of the highest-impact issues for the business. You'll highlight areas where the business needs resourcing or process, own implementation, and be a sounding board for leadership. Own core company operations, including: - Team-wide meetings and events (e.g., All Hands, off-sites, marketing events) - People operations, including recruiting, onboarding, performance - Implementing new tools and processes across functions as we grow Run a function: If a business area needs attention (e.g., marketing, sales, HR), you'll step in and tackle it. You might work on employee onboarding one week and dig into sales operations the next. Who We're Looking For You're excited to roll up your sleeves and dig into operations from the ground-up. You find a way to make things happen. You're scrappy and efficient when faced with limited resources. You're highly organized, process-driven, and detail-oriented, but you are thoughtful about applying processes where they are impactful and avoid wasting time where they aren't. You enjoy problem-solving in the chaotic nature of early-stage start-ups. Empathy. You seek out opportunities to relate to others across the company because connection matters to you and because it contributes to higher-impact work. You've worked in an operational role at a Seed, Series A, or Series B startup (and ideally across functions). You're comfortable working in an early stage context (low bureaucracy, high uncertainty), and are an open-minded thinker. Cultural Caveats We're a dynamic early stage startup. We hold some strong opinions that you should probably know going in. Early stage: We believe in critical thinking, open discussion, and failing fast. Fully remote, with offsites: We live in different cities across the US and Europe. We don't care where you live as long as the time zones work well. We expect you to travel to meet in person every few months. We think better as a group when physically together. Independent action with fuzzy roles: Everyone at Coiled is busy with company execution, so we expect you to self-manage well. This includes identifying priorities, communicating and engaging with the team, executing well, taking feedback, and course-correcting. In the course of all this you'll likely do tasks outside of your stated role. Hopefully you're excited by that openness! We fire people: The company moves quickly and sometimes excellent teammates stop being a good fit. In these cases we separate. You should only join us if you have some risk tolerance. We find that this culture creates an environment that is intellectually stimulating, impact-oriented, and honest with itself (we avoid standard startup hype). If the cultural caveats above resonate with you then we're excited to meet you, regardless of your match for the position stated above. \n \n Please mention the word **REALISTIC** and tag RMTA1LjExMi45OS4yMTY= when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMTA1LjExMi45OS4yMTY=).

Technology Fluency I apply a comprehensive understanding of the Voltron Data technology stack and relevant external technologies within my focus. I both maintain awareness and ensure my organization is aware of changes as they occur. I influence partner organizations' design and architecture choices. I understand that technology, threats, and responses evolve and use that evolution to identify opportunities to improve security controls accordingly. Threat Fluency I deeply understand attacker tools, techniques, and processes (TTPs) and an extensive array of defenses/mitigations for them. I am deeply aware of the kinds of defenses and their efficacy in mitigating attacks relevant to Voltron Data Security.

Launched in 2011, Getaround is available today in more than 1,000 cities across the United States and Europe. We connect safe, convenient, and affordable cars with people who need them to live and work via our peer-to-peer marketplace. Our proprietary connected car technology allows guests to book and unlock a wide variety of vehicles directly from our app without ever having to meet anyone in person, carry an access card, wait in line, or coordinate picking up keys, unlike traditional rental car services. Getaround is focused on providing economic opportunities to local communities. Our community includes guests who rely on our cars for on-demand mobility and entrepreneurial hosts (car owners) who share cars on our platform including those who operate their own carsharing businesses. Did you know cars are parked 22 hours a day on average? When we share cars, we don't need as many on the road, which means fewer accidents, reduced traffic, and less space required for parking. Carsharing modernizes mobility by allowing people to connect multiple forms of efficient transportation for any type of use case. Through carsharing, we aim to lessen greenhouse gasses and reduce pollution. Studies show that when carsharing is available, people drive less and drive vehicles more appropriate for their use case, which can reduce household carbon emissions by up to 40%. Also, shared cars are used more frequently and retired more quickly, accelerating the adoption of newer, more energy-efficient vehicles.

Marketing Generalist,Goldsky,Worldwide,"About Goldsky At Goldsky, our vision is simple: Build the most powerful data platform for Web3. âï¸ Blockchains will enable a new era of unique onchain experiences and applications. However, today it's impossible to build high-quality products due to the difficulties of processing onchain data effectively. This complexity is only increasing as more chains and smart contracts are deployed across the ecosystem. Teams are forced to build complex data infrastructure in-house, distracting them from focusing on their core product. Goldsky bridges this gap by making it seamless for developers to power their applications with realtime onchain data. Our infrastructure powers hundreds of projects across the industry building rich, instant, data-driven experiences. We've raised over $20M from Dragonfly Capital, Felicis Ventures, prominent players in the industry such as 0x Labs, Uniswap Labs, and Protocol Labs, and angel investors including Elad Gil, Plaid founders Zach Perret and William Hockey, and Zhuoxun Yin of Magic Eden. Our team members have previously built mission-critical, scalable infrastructure at Meta, Google, Shopify, Activision, and more. We'd love for you to join us in our mission to unlock the full potential of data in Web3. About the Role We launched our first product, Subgraphs , last year. Since then, we've onboarded hundreds of customers to the platform, including Zora, Optimism, POAP, NounsDAO, 0x Labs, Immutable, Hashflow, Arweave, and Polymarket, among others. Recently, we began rolling out access to Mirror , an end-to-end data pipeline solution for streaming onchain data directly to an existing offchain database. We're looking for a Marketing pro to define and execute our product marketing strategy against all of our GTM campaigns - including but not limited to - product launches, content launches, brand marketing, events, and documentation. You'll own the success of the product, brand, and content, and use data to shape and adjust our strategy over time. You will work closely with the founders and collaborate with all of Goldsky (across product, engineering, and growth) to grow Goldsky's brand presence in the space, as well as reliably and predictably drive inbound demand. We would expect a great candidate to have at least 4-6 years of experience, but have seen exceptional candidates break this rule. Responsibilities Go Broad and Deep on Crypto Data: Conduct ongoing market research to gather data on target markets and customer needs, inform positioning and product strategy, and identify marketing campaign opportunities. You'll know the ins and outs of the industry like no one else. Position Goldsky in the Market : Work with the Goldsky team to develop an in-depth understanding of our products and customers, enabling you to distill these stories into broadly consumable content that engages, educates, and drives inbound demand. Set and Keep the Pace : Create and manage Goldsky's content calendar across channels, projects, and campaigns with consideration for broader market trends and audience behaviour. Track the performance of this content to drive continuous improvement. Own Goldsky's Voice : Become an advocate for Goldsky across channels, engaging in dialogue with our ecosystem, answering questions, and raising the profile of Goldsky with an engaging, fresh, and informed perspective (and an occasional shitpost here and there) Experiment : Brainstorm, pitch, and execute on any other initiatives you think can help grow Goldsky's brand presence (with a budget to help make them happen); SEO, SEM, referral campaigns & other contests, B2B2C partnerships, webinars, and more. Requirements Stellar storytelling : You are a creative and thoughtful writer that can adapt key messages to different audiences and channels seamlessly, and you know what it's like to build credibility for a new product with both technical and non-technical content Technical proficiency: You don't need to be an engineer, but should be able to quickly grasp the technical story of Goldsky's developer-facing products and convey those value propositions to the broad market at different levels of technical understanding Data-driven : You are experienced with managing multiple workstreams end-to-end, and creating analytics (supported by the data tools you need) to measure the success of those workstreams and improve performance over time. Chronically online : You spend a lot of time on Twitter, Discord, LinkedIn, Farcaster, and Reddit â both as a reader and a writer. You have built a presence on one of these channels in the past (personally or professionally). Early-stage, remote, and/or crypto experience : You have demonstrated success at an early-stage startup or similar (3+ yrs), a remote-first environment (1+ yrs), and/or at a crypto company in marketing (1+ yrs). You may not have all three, but at least 1 is mandatory. Bonus points You are good with crypto data (Dune / Flipside analytics) and can convert analytics into interesting insights for content. You've worked with highly technical products and customers in the past; even better if you've worked in B2B SaaS or developer tooling specifically. Benefits Competitive salary and equity in Goldsky. Fully paid health plans for U.S. based employees â this includes medical, dental, and vision coverage for you and your family at no cost to you. Unlimited vacation - Take time to recharge as you need it. We're serious.

Technical Product Manager,Conduit,"San Francisco, Remote","Conduit - The Onchain Compute Company At Conduit, we're building the rollup-native cloud platform that will scale Ethereum. Crypto builders have been held back by a lack of onchain compute â without the ability to process a high volume of transactions quickly and cheaply, onchain apps and ecosystems can't build high quality user experiences. Rollups have emerged as the answer to this problem. Just as servers work together to scale compute in web2, so too can rollups scale onchain compute in web3. But building and operating your own rollup is difficult and time-consuming. That's where Conduit comes in. As the rollup-native cloud platform, Conduit combines web2 engineering best-practices with web3 rollup technology to make it easy for anyone to launch and maintain their own chain. By making infrastructure simple and onchain compute abundant, similar to how AWS and GCP did for web2, we can unlock the next wave of innovation in the crypto ecosystem. The Conduit platform has seen massive growth since going live in 2023. We run the largest chains in production, including Proof of Play, Zora, Aevo, and more . This translates to 200+ chains across mainnet and testnet and over $1B in total-value-locked (TVL). We're operating on the bleeding edge of crypto, co-evolving with our customers and integration partners, and pushing the limits of blockchain scalability and modularity. This success has been recognized and accelerated through a $37M Series A , co-led by Paradigm and Haun Ventures â two of the best investors in the industry. We're an elite team that's previously worked at Meta, Brex, Wish, Compound, Chainalysis, Immunefi, Amazon, Avara/Aave, Paradigm, and more. We're headquartered in San Francisco, with team members all over the world. We're looking for ambitious, talented builders that want to help scale Ethereum and bring crypto compute to the masses. Join us! About the Role: As our internal roadmap gets more complex, we're looking to bring on a Technical Product Manager that will work closely with engineers across the team to align on internal goals, timelines, and priorities. You'll be responsible for the success of the product â from architecture and design to implementation and iteration â and understand every nook and cranny of the infrastructure. You would partner with Andrew (CEO), Thomas (Head of Engineer), Emiliano (Rollup Lead), and others across the company to ensure we are delivering on our key product areas and serving customers better every day. Responsibilities: Deliver Consistently and Efficiently: Keep us on course with our ambitious roadmap.

The protocol provides a decentralized, transparent alternative to traditional insurance companies. The economic incentives within the mutual solve the centralized insurance industry's core problem: the principal-agent problem. What we are looking for We are looking for a Smart Contract Engineer who can help us build the premier on-chain risk marketplace for DeFi, CeFi and beyond. You can learn more about us here: Twitter , Discord , Github .

You have an understanding of layer 2 protocols, bridges and blockchain interoperability About us We are a small and dynamic team, passion for our work describes and sets the tone for everything that we do. We are a fully remote organisation that strives to pave the way for the future of insurance Our compensation package is comprised of a competitive fixed (fiat component) plus a generous token allocation Why are we doing this? The concept of insurance comes from communities in the past that pooled their resources to protect each other from the risks they all faced. It works better the more people are in the pool as the numbers become more reliable . But this method isn't scalable because it is a trust-based system and the network of individuals trusted by everyone in the pool only extends so far . Hence traditional insurance companies emerged. When Ethereum and smart contracts came along we realized we could apply our insurance industry knowledge to our passion for decentralised technology. We realized we could build a mutual on a platform where individuals only need to trust the system, not everyone in it. Specifically, we could see a solution to the problem of agencyâwhere an insurer looks after customers' money on their behalf. We also saw the opportunity to make significant cost savings compared to the traditional insurance model. As we're already in the UK, we have the perfect base to build out this concept due to the existing law around mutuality. The aim is to provide our members with more simple, transparent, accessible, and affordable financial protection against their risks.

Software Engineer Frontend,Goldsky,Worldwide,"About Goldsky At Goldsky, our vision is simple: Build the most powerful data platform for Web3. âï¸ Blockchains will enable a new era of unique onchain experiences and applications. However, today it's impossible to build high-quality products due to the difficulties of processing onchain data effectively. This complexity is only increasing as more chains and smart contracts are deployed across the ecosystem. Teams are forced to build complex data infrastructure in-house, distracting them from focusing on their core product. Goldsky bridges this gap by making it seamless for developers to power their applications with realtime onchain data. Our infrastructure powers hundreds of projects across the industry building rich, instant, data-driven experiences. We've raised over $20M from Dragonfly Capital, Felicis Ventures, prominent players in the industry such as 0x Labs, Uniswap Labs, and Protocol Labs, and angel investors including Elad Gil, Plaid founders Zach Perret and William Hockey, and Zhuoxun Yin of Magic Eden. Our team members have previously built mission-critical, scalable infrastructure at Meta, Google, Shopify, Activision, and more. We'd love for you to join us in our mission to unlock the full potential of data in Web3. About the Role We launched our first product, Subgraphs , last year. Since then, we've onboarded hundreds of customers to the platform, including Zora, Optimism, POAP, NounsDAO, 0x Labs, Immutable, Hashflow, Arweave, and Polymarket, among others. Recently, we began rolling out access to Mirror , an end-to-end data pipeline solution for streaming onchain data directly to an existing offchain database. As we continue to grow, we are looking to bring on a Frontend Engineer who will be pivotal in crafting intuitive, dynamic, and high-performance user interfaces. This role involves working closely with our product and design teams to deliver a seamless user experience, ensuring our platform is both powerful and user-friendly. You'll be working with a world-class data engineering team with experience in architecting (not just building or using) the production streaming systems at companies like Shopify, Activision, and more. We regularly present at data engineering conferences and merge changes back into upstream projects, so a love of open-source could be helpful. Experience with Blockchain and Web3 is not required, but having proficiency in modern frontend frameworks and a keen eye for design will definitely make a candidate stand out. Responsibilities: Develop User Interfaces: Create and maintain intuitive and responsive user interfaces that allow users to easily interact with complex data-driven applications. You'll be building the frontend for our cutting-edge Web3 data products. Collaborate with Design and Product Teams: Work closely with our design and product teams to translate wireframes and prototypes into high-quality code. You'll ensure that the user experience is cohesive, accessible, and performant. Optimize Performance: Identify bottlenecks and ensure our web applications are fast, responsive, and optimized for all users. This includes optimizing load times and managing state efficiently. Problem-Solve on the Fly: We're building sophisticated tools in a completely new industry, where there are many things to discover. Problems will arise that have never been solved, and you'll be able to figure out the âgood enoughâ solution consistently as we run into lots of novel technical challenges. You have the drive to work through hard problems, the curiosity to dig deeper and understand the root cause of a problem, and the grit to iterate through first attempts that lead to the right solution over time. Build Systems Incrementally: As we grow, we are looking to build incrementally but with a strong vision for the future architecture. While we actively embrace âthrow-away work' when the situation demands, we're at a point where sustainable scaling is important, and we're looking for someone who can walk that balance. We're excited to talk with you if: You are passionate about building clean, scalable, and maintainable frontend architectures. You should have experience with modern frontend frameworks such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Svelte, and other tools. You enjoy the high-level strategy work as well as the implementation, and you get excited about seeing users interact with the interfaces you've built. You're curious, low ego, and always looking to improve. You experiment with strategies, tactics, and tools in order to identify what works, and you adjust to find repeatable success. You're open to feedback and collaborating with others to get to the best approach. You're hungry and excited to join a high-growth, fast-paced startup where you'll get your hands dirty across a range of challenges. You're comfortable in an ambiguous, remote environment without much structure. You enjoy building long-term relationships with teammates and customers. You're open and curious to learn more about this wacky world of crypto :) Bonus points for: You also feel comfortable with backend or data engineering. Though not explicitly required, the more you can get your hands on â the better! You've worked with highly technical products and customers; even better if you've worked in B2B SaaS. You're crypto native, familiar with the broader ecosystem, and understand why Goldsky will unlock new experiences and applications in Web3. Benefits Competitive salary and equity in Goldsky. Fully paid health plans for U.S. based employees â This includes medical, dental, and vision coverage for you and your family at no cost to you. Unlimited vacation - Take time to recharge as you need it. We're serious. Home office setup fund - Expense up to $2,000 for home office equipment (e.g. desk, chair) Company provided laptop - we'll make sure you've got the hardware to keep up with you Wellness stipend - Expense up to $100/mo on whatever helps you stay healthy.

Protocol Security Engineer,Aztec,Global Remote,"About Aztec At Aztec, our goal is to add privacy to Ethereum. In the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get trustlessness. Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions. Implementing scalable encryption in a public blockchain paradigm requires cutting-edge math and engineering. Thankfully, our team of scientists and engineers invented Plonk, the industry-standard zkSNARK, and Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge. Now, we're building a first of its kind Layer 2 with private smart contracts. This requires new cryptographic primitives, a zero-knowledge DSL for writing contracts, a privacy-friendly execution environment, a carefully designed set of circuits that prove the validity of the chain to L1, a decentralized block-building and proving mechanism, and a top-tier user and developer experience. And it's now time to bring it to market. We've raised $125 million from industry-leading investors including a16z crypto, Paradigm, Variant, Consensys, and a_capital, and we're growing quickly. Role We are looking for an applied cryptographer or a cybersecurity professional with love for applied cryptography, and with experience in auditing and breaking cryptographic protocols to join our security team.
